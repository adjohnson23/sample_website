        <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>

        <p>
            Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach <em>technical sophistication</em>, 
            the seemingly magical ability to take command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. 
            This cindlues everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts, 
            Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing. 
            We believe there are <strong><em>at least a billion people</em></strong> who can benefit from learning 
            technical sophistication, probably more. To join our movement, <a href="https://learnenough.com/email">sign up for our official email list</a> now.

        <h2>Founders</h2>

        <p>
            Learn Enough to be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
            Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical
            sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit
            at least a billion people, and probably more.

            Michael is the creator of the <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/">
            Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
            <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a>
            introductory sequence. He is an advanced student of
            <a href="https://www.kravmaga.com/">Krav Maga</a> and has a three-step

            are slightly exaggerated.
